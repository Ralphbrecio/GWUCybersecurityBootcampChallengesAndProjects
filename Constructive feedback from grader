Security culture assessment and Strategies to mitigate potential risks
Hey Ralph!

Very well done on identifying potential security threats to employees and preferred employee behavior and method to measure the and set a goal for employee aligning to the preferred behavior on Step-1!

Step 2-- Ralph. Very innovatively, you've clearly explained how departments and tech teams can be involved as well as described well their roles and responsibilities. Here you have also specified Top Leadership and Finance Leadership team to be involved and their respective roles. Excellent job done !

On the same note, you have demonstrated well on training topics that can be covered for employees. You have done an excellent job on describing the deliverables of the topics in detail !

Good job on the bonus questions ! I really appreciate your security awareness not only on the technical level of updating security software, but also preventing breaches from a physical standpoint!

This is a good start to your 24 week journey. Ralph; keep up the good work and this smooth flow you've established!
